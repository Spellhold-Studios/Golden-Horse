Version: 1.5e

MOD CONTENT:
------------
This mod adds 1 Revan Artecratos selectable class: Assassin/Mage, Thief/Mage, Fighter/Mage/Thief
7 NPCs without any dialogue see MERCENARIES: New items and new encounters.

MAIN NPC:
---------
Revan Artecratos is a fugitive from Moonsea trying to establish his new life in Athkatla. However, recent events
have revealed to him that there is someone with influence who can cast shadow long enough
to reach from Moonsea to Athkatla.

Revan does not have a lot of interactions, though he does have at least one banter with each
Bioware NPC in SoA (less in ToB). If you are looking for a fully fleshed out NPC telling his life story
throughout BG2, you may be disappointed.
This mod is more about protecting an NPC from assassins with a story tying it all together.
