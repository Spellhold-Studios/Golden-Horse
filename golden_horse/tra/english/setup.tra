At first Fulvuril attempted to get the blade peacefully but Chark was unbending so Fulvuril attempted to steal but Chark was just too fast for Fulvuril. Next Fulvuril attempted to throw vial of magical sleeping dust at Chark but he caught the vial mid air. Desperate Fulvuril brought in some elves from Evereska to help him. Elves prepared ambush with traps and archers however again Charks dexterity foiled their plans as Chark jumped away from trap and deflected arrow mid air. Scholars do not write what happened next but its most likely that elves killed Chark since Moonblade appeared in Evereska possessed by Fulvuril's family. Some say that Chark escaped and moved where elven assassins could not reach him.

Since Pvolmier was tough minded but not a great blacksmith or great enchanter he would spend next three years perfecting concept creating many prototypes. Failure is not an option he would say to his enchanter. Nevertheless in DR1344 by that time due to expenses of his pet project Pvolmier was quite destitute he succeeded. This poleaxe seems to be massively enlarged version of original war hammer. Given ornamentation, ridiculous size and weight this weapon was supposed to be used city of Ihragan for ceremonial purposes.

Rod never found much usage despite being highly enchanted due to seemingly useless nature of draining charisma ability and its wisdom requirement.

Other scholars speculate artifact could have been made by psionics. As psionics are known to manipulate present time.
This lack of written down history of the artifacts have led some scholars to speculate that power of gauntlets over time causes gaps of knowledge about history of artifact.
Gauntlets first appear in DR794 record is about unknown adventurer who lost them in gamble to Barbarian fighting cleric named Kersutim Namahan used his newly augmented fighting skills to become Chieftain and attempted to unite neighboring tribes. Though his campaign was cut short when he fell to trap laid by one of the opposing tribes.
Second record is from DR1269 when they were found by Cleric named Esmer but he was unable to use them so he passed them to fighting Cleric Ehgel Enerviel who used them for good measure against Illithids in Underdark. How did the gauntlets appeared back to surface is not known since Ehgel perished there not by Illithids though.
Third and last is from Durpar where unknown adventurers challenged lycanthrope Grush Silverback to one on one duel. Amused Grush accepted and brought two Clay Golems as backup but was slain by adventurer wearing the gauntlets.

Ability 1:
  Effect: Zone of Sweet Air (Abjuration)
  Sphere: Wards
  Range: 30 yards
  Area of Effect: Special

Zone of Sweet Air repels all noxious elements from poisonous vapors (including magically created vapors such as Cloudkill).  This spell will dismiss all clouds in the entire area that the caster is currently in.  The spell offers no protection against poisonous vapors created by a dragon's breath weapon (such as the chlorine gas of a green dragon).

Ability 2:
  Effect: Knock
  Range: Visual range of caster
  Area of Effect: Locked door or chest

  The knock spell opens locked, held or wizard-locked doors.  It opens secret doors, as well as locked boxes or chests.  It does not raise barred gates or similar impediments.

Ability 3:
  Effect: Remove Curse
  Range: 15 feet

  Upon casting this spell, the wizard is usually able to remove a curse on an object, on a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. Note that the remove curse spell does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, for example, although the spell typically enables the person afflicted with any such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or more.
