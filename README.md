## Introduction

This mod introduces a joinable NPC, Revan Artecratos, with a story, new items, and encounters. Additionally, several minor NPCs are available for hire as mercenaries.

*Please check the complete [Readme](https://spellhold-studios.github.io/readmes/golden-horse/golden_horse_readme.txt) to learn more about this mod before installation.*

## Revan Artecratos

Revan is a fugitive from Moonsea trying to establish his new life in Athkatla; however, recent events have revealed to him that there is someone with influence who can cast shadow long enough to reach from Moonsea to Athkatla.

Revan does not have a lot of interactions, though he does have at least one banter with each Bioware NPC in SoA (less in ToB). If you are looking for a fully-fleshed NPC telling his life story throughout BG2, you may be disappointed. This mod is more about protecting an NPC from assassins with a story tying it all together.
