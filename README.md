## Introduction

This mod introduces a joinable NPC, Revan Artecratos, with a story, new items, and encounters. Additionally, several minor NPCs are available for hire as mercenaries.

*Please check the complete [Readme](https://spellhold-studios.github.io/readmes/golden-horse/golden_horse_readme.txt) to learn more about this mod before installation.*

## Revan Artecratos

Revan Artecratos is a fugitive from the Moonsea trying to establish his new life in Athkatla; however, recent events have revealed to him that there is someone with influence who can cast shadow long enough to reach from the Moonsea to Athkatla.

Revan does not have a lot of interactions, though he does have at least one banter with each Bioware NPC in SoA (less in ToB). If you are looking for a fully fleshed out NPC telling his life story throughout BG2, you may be disappointed. This mod is more about protecting an NPC from assassins with a story tying it all together.

### Biography

> When asked about his past, Revan says he was born in the Moonsea. He did not know who his parents were, but his adoptive father was human. When Revan grew up, he joined a mercenary company. He ascended through ranks to become a captain, which, in a company, means leader. He further elaborates that he expanded from leading men into battle to more subtle jobs requiring highly trained small teams. However, trouble has forced him to leave the Moonsea, and since then, he has tried to establish his own mercenary company in Amn.

## Key features

- A joinable NPC, Revan Artecratos, selectable as Assassin/Mage, Thief/Mage, or Fighter/Mage/Thief
- 7 minor NPCs without any dialogue available as mercenaries
